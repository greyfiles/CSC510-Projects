## Essay 
> ### ** 🔍 Challenges Faced 🔍 **

** Outdated Dependencies **: Some projects relied on specific software dependencies and libraries that had either been deprecated or updated significantly since the code was written. Trying to find the exact versions or suitable substitutes was a demanding task.
** Lack of Documentation **: A significant pain point was the lack of comprehensive documentation. While there were comments within the code, a broader overview or setup guide was missing, which made understanding the code's flow and dependencies harder.
** Code Complexity and Clarity **: Some sections of the code were intricate, with functions spanning multiple lines without clear segmentation or descriptive variable naming. This complexity made deciphering the code's purpose and function challenging.
** Platform Compatibility Issues **: The Git project we choose seemed to have been developed for a particular operating system. Running it on a different platform required tweaks and adjustments, indicating a lack of cross-platform foresight.

> ### **🛠️ Solutions and Learnings**(Avoiding the Pain:) 🛠️

To tackle these challenges, we took a systematic approach:

- **Code Inspection**: Before even attempting to run the system, we studied the code, especially the README files, for any setup instructions. This helped us understand the overall architecture and identify potential pitfalls.
  
- **Dependencies**: We quickly realized the importance of virtual environments. Different projects might require different versions of libraries, and without virtual environments, managing these would be nightmarish.
  
- **Testing**: After setting up, running tests (if available) gave us a good idea of what's working and what's not. This was our first real interaction with the system.

> ### **🌟 Best Practices for Future 🌟**(Commitments for Project2:)

For our subsequent projects, we are committed to:

1. **Documentation**: Writing comprehensive documentation, especially a detailed README with setup instructions, known issues, and solutions.
   
2. **Version Control**: Clearly mentioning required versions for all dependencies.
   
3. **Testing**: Regularly updating and running tests, ensuring they cover a significant portion of the codebase.
